📝 Notepad Made in Tkinter
This is a simple notepad-like text editor built using Python’s Tkinter library.

What I Learned
While working on this project, I explored Tkinter's Text widget for multi-line text input and went deeper into the filedialog module than I did yesterday.

I learned how to:

Open and read files using askopenfilename()

Save files using asksaveasfilename()

Handle file paths and content properly in a GUI environment
